# Laser-Defender
A clone of the popular arcade game 'Laser Defender'. made using Unity3D and C#.

In order to gain a head start on my game development training, I decided to pursue a Udemy course, Complete Unity Developer in C# by Ben Tristem>
This course teaches the basics of Unity game development through C#. Laser defender is one of the 7 games this course teaches you through
hands on learning.
